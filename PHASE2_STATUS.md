## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Audio Processing Flow

```
Discord Voice (48kHz Opus Stereo)
          ↓
    Opus Decoder
          ↓
   PCM Audio (48kHz Stereo)
          ↓
  Downsampler + Mono Converter

### File Structure

```

├── index.js              # Main bot (updated)

└── ai/
    └── transcriber.js    # NEW: Gemini Live API integration
```

## 📊 How It Works

### 1. Audio Capture (`receiver.js`)
- Listens to Discord voice channel
- Detects when users start speaking
- Captures audio streams in Opus format
- Converts to PCM format

### 2. Audio Processing
- Decodes Opus to PCM (48kHz stereo)
- Downsamples to 16kHz (Gemini requirement)
- Converts stereo to mono
- Encodes to base64

### 3. Transcription (`transcriber.js`)
- Connects to Gemini Live API
- Sends audio chunks in real-time
- Receives transcription responses
- Triggers callback with transcribed text

### 4. Message Posting
- Receives transcription from callback
- Creates formatted Discord embed
- Posts to the text channel

## 🎯 Key Features

### Gemini Live API Configuration

```javascript
const model = 'gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview';
const config = {
  responseModalities: [Modality.TEXT], // Text output only
  inputAudioTranscription: {},         // Enable transcription
};
```

### Audio Format Requirements

| Parameter | Value | Note |
|-----------|-------|------|
| **Sample Rate** | 16kHz | Required by Gemini |
| **Channels** | Mono (1) | Single channel |
| **Bit Depth** | 16-bit | PCM signed integer |
| **Format** | PCM | Raw audio data |
| **Encoding** | Base64 | For transmission |

### Discord Audio Format

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Sample Rate** | 48kHz |
| **Channels** | Stereo (2) |
| **Codec** | Opus |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "GEMINI_API_KEY is not set"
1. Get API key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
2. Add to `.env` file
3. Restart the bot

### No transcriptions appearing
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify Gemini API key is valid
3. Make sure you're speaking clearly
4. Check internet connection

### "Failed to connect to Gemini"
- Check API key is correct
- Verify internet connection
- Check Gemini API quota/limits
- Try again in a few seconds

### Audio quality issues
- Speak clearly and at normal volume
- Reduce background noise
- Ensure good Discord connection
- Wait for silence detection (1 second)

---

## 🔍 Testing Tips

### Test Transcription Quality

1. **Clear Speech:**
   - Speak clearly and at normal pace
   - Avoid mumbling or very fast speech

2. **Silence Detection:**
   - Bot waits 1 second of silence before processing
   - Pause between sentences for best results

3. **Multiple Speakers:**
   - Each person's speech is transcribed separately
   - Transcriptions appear as they finish speaking

### Monitor Console Output

```
🎤 Started listening to voice channel
👤 User 123456789 started speaking
🔊 Received 45 audio chunks from user 123456789
🎵 Processing audio from user 123456789
📤 Sent audio to Gemini for transcription
📝 Transcription: Hello, this is a test
✅ Turn complete
```

## 📈 Performance Notes

### Latency
- **Discord → Bot:** ~100ms (network)
- **Audio Processing:** ~50ms (local)
- **Gemini API:** ~500-1500ms (varies)
- **Total:** ~1-2 seconds typical

### Resource Usage
- CPU: Low (audio processing is efficient)
