# 🎉 Real-Time Speech-to-Text Implementation Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### Core Features
1. ✅ **Audio Capture System** (`src/audio/receiver.js`)
   - Captures Discord voice channel audio
   - Handles Opus decoding
   - Converts to Gemini-compatible format (16kHz mono PCM)

2. ✅ **Gemini Live API Integration** (`src/ai/transcriber.js`)
   - Real-time connection to Gemini Live API
   - Streams audio for transcription
   - Handles transcription callbacks

3. ✅ **Discord Integration** (Updated `src/index.js`)
   - Auto-starts transcription when joining voice
   - Posts transcriptions to text channel
   - Clean disconnect and cleanup

### Technical Achievements
- ✅ Audio format conversion (48kHz stereo → 16kHz mono)
- ✅ Opus codec handling
- ✅ WebSocket connection to Gemini
- ✅ Async audio processing
- ✅ Multi-user support

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Bot won't start
- Check `.env` has all required keys
- Run `npm install` again
- Verify Node.js version (18+)

### No Gemini connection
- Verify API key at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
- Check for typos in `.env`
- No spaces around the `=` sign
- Restart bot after editing `.env`

### No transcriptions
- Speak clearly with pauses
- Check console for errors
- Verify internet connection
- Check Gemini API quota

### Audio quality issues
- Reduce background noise
- Speak at normal volume
- Wait for 1 second of silence
- Check Discord voice connection
