# 🔧 Audio Processing Fix

## Issue Fixed
**Error:** "The compressed data passed is corrupted"

## Root Cause
The Discord voice receiver (`receiver.subscribe()`) already provides **decoded PCM audio**, not Opus-encoded data. We were incorrectly trying to decode it again with the Opus decoder.

## Solution
Removed the unnecessary Opus decoding step. The audio pipeline now:

```
Discord Voice Receiver
        ↓
PCM Audio (48kHz stereo) ← Already decoded!
        ↓
Downsample to 16kHz + Convert to Mono
        ↓
Send to Gemini
```

## Changes Made
1. Removed Opus decoder initialization
2. Removed `decodeOpusToPCM()` method
3. Removed unused imports (prism-media, pipeline, promisify)
4. Directly process PCM buffer from Discord

## Updated Flow
```javascript
// Before (WRONG):
audioStream → Opus Decoder → PCM → Convert → Gemini ❌

// After (CORRECT):
audioStream (already PCM) → Convert → Gemini ✅
```

## Why This Works
Discord's `@discordjs/voice` library handles Opus decoding internally. When you subscribe to a user's audio stream, you receive **raw PCM samples** at 48kHz stereo, 16-bit signed integers.

## Testing
Restart the bot and try speaking again. You should now see:
```
✅ Connected to Gemini Live API
🎤 Started listening to voice channel
👤 User started speaking
🔊 Received audio chunks
🎵 Processing audio
📤 Sent audio to Gemini for transcription
📝 Transcription: [your words]
```

No more "corrupted data" errors! ✨

## Notes
- We still keep the conversion to 16kHz mono (required by Gemini)
- No external dependencies needed for basic audio processing
- More efficient (one less decode step)
- Lower latency
