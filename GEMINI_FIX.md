# üîß Gemini Transcription Fix

## Issue
Audio was being sent to Gemini, but no transcriptions were being received.

## Root Causes

### 1. Missing Audio Stream End Signal
Gemini Live API requires an `audioStreamEnd: true` signal to know when to process the audio chunk. Without it, Gemini just buffers the audio indefinitely.

### 2. Wrong Configuration
Using `inputAudioTranscription: {}` was intended for getting transcripts OF the audio metadata, not for getting responses.

### 3. Incomplete Message Handling
We weren't checking all possible locations where Gemini sends text responses.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Stream End Signal
```javascript
// Send audio
this.session.sendRealtimeInput({
  audio: { data: base64Audio, mimeType: 'audio/pcm;rate=16000' }
});

// NEW: Signal end of audio stream
this.session.sendRealtimeInput({
  audioStreamEnd: true
});
```

### 2. Updated Configuration
```javascript
const config = {
  responseModalities: [Modality.TEXT],
  systemInstruction: 'You are a speech-to-text transcriber. Simply transcribe what the user says, word for word.'
};
```

### 3. Enhanced Message Handling
Now checks for text in multiple locations:
- `message.text`
- `message.serverContent.modelTurn.parts[].text`
- Logs all messages for debugging

## Expected Behavior Now

### Console Output:
```
üì§ Sending 32000 bytes of audio to Gemini...
üì§ Sent audio to Gemini for transcription
üì® Received message from Gemini: {...}
üìù Transcription: Hello, this is a test
‚úÖ Turn complete
```

### Discord Output:
Beautiful embed with the transcribed text!

## How to Test

1. **Restart the bot:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **In Discord:**
   - Join voice channel
   - Type `!join`
   - Speak clearly
   - Wait 1-2 seconds

3. **Watch console for:**
   - "Sent audio to Gemini"
   - "Received message from Gemini"
   - "Transcription: [your words]"

## Debugging Tips

If still not working:

1. **Check console logs** - We now log ALL messages from Gemini
2. **Check audio size** - Should see "Sending X bytes"
3. **Verify API key** - Make sure it's valid
4. **Check quota** - Visit https://aistudio.google.com

## Technical Notes

### Why `audioStreamEnd` is needed:
Gemini Live API uses streaming protocol. It needs to know:
- When audio starts (first audio chunk)
- When audio ends (`audioStreamEnd: true`)
- Only then it processes and responds

### Audio Format:
- **Input:** PCM 16kHz mono 16-bit
- **Encoding:** Base64
- **MIME type:** `audio/pcm;rate=16000`

### Response Flow:
```
1. Send audio chunk
2. Send audioStreamEnd signal
3. Gemini processes audio
4. Gemini sends back message with text
5. We extract text and call callback
6. Discord posts transcription
```

## Success Indicators

‚úÖ Console shows "Received message from Gemini"
‚úÖ Console shows "Transcription: [text]"
‚úÖ Discord shows embedded message with transcription
‚úÖ No errors in console

**The fix is ready! Restart the bot and try speaking again.** üéâ
